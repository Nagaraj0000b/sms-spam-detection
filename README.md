# First Machine Learning Project: Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the basics of linear regression using Python. Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict a continuous value (e.g., salary) based on input features using a linear model.
- **Techniques Used:** Simple linear regression, data visualization, model evaluation.
- **Files:**
	- `predctionOfSalary.py`: Main code for linear regression.
	- `salary_data.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.

## How to Run
1. Open `predctionOfSalary.py`.
2. Ensure `salary_data.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Run the script to train and test the linear regression model.

## Key Concepts
- Fitting a line to data points
- Calculating coefficients
- Making predictions
- Evaluating model performance
